**Ecosound** is an open source python package to facilitate the analysis of passive acoustic data. It includes modules for manual annotation
processing and visualization, automatic detection, signal classification, and localization. It heavily relies on libraries such as xarray,
pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. Under the hood it also uses dask which supports the processing of large data sets that donâ€™t fit into memory,
and makes processing scalable through distributed computing (on either local clusters or on the cloud). Outputs from ecosound are compatible 
with popular bioacoustics software such as `Raven <https://ravensoundsoftware.com/>`_ and 
`PAMlab <https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52aa2773e4b0f29916f46675/t/5be5b07088251b9f59268184/1541779574284/PAMlab+Brochure.pdf>`_.
